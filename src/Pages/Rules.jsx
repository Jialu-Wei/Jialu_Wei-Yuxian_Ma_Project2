            <h2>How to Play Battleships</h2>
            <p>This game of guessing, strategy and logical thought dates back to before world war one and is known the world over for being a simple game that can be played with no more than a pencil and two pieces of paper. It is a two player game which has since been released by many board game manufacturers and its popularity can be seen through not only the intricate detail now put into physical and digital renditions of it, but now also in a Hollywood film based on the game.</p>
            <h3>Start/Preparation</h3>
            <p>Each game can vary in the number of ships employed but a common practice is to have 5 ships of differing size (2 to 5) squares. An aircraft carrier is 5 squares long, a battleship is 4 squares long, both a submarine and a destroyer are three squares long and a patrol boat is two squares long. Each player must secretly place their ships on a grid of ten columns by ten rows. These represent the location of the ships on a battlefield. Each player will also be in possession of a second grid of the same size. Where the first grid is their own ships, the second one (which is blank at the beginning of the game) is a mirror of their opponentâ€™s battlefield.</p>
